	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<h2>My name is Wing Yi Ma, Maggie.</h2>
	<h3>This is where you can get to know about me!
		I am currently a third year statistics students studying at <em>the University of Toronto</em>. </h3>
	<p>I started studying Statistics because I am a person who loves to ask the question "Why?". 
		Finding out reasons and associations between things was always my first approach to things happening around me. </p>
	<p>When I am out of school, I love spending time on watching movies, making crafts, and listening to music.
		Here, I would like to share my recent favourite movie - <em>Soul</em>. It was very inspiriting because it introduced a new perspective about life to me. 
		As I love seeking reasons and purposes, the quote from the movie - <em>"A spark isn't a soul's purpose"</em> has stimulated me to reconsider the "purpose" of my life.
		Maybe life doesn't necessarily need "A purpose"? Or maybe every moment and thing I spend time on can be the "purposes"?<br/>
		I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is trying to find a purpose in life, or just wants to be motivated in what they are doing.</p>
	<p><b>If you are interested in finding out more about me and my past experience as a Statistics student, feel free to have a look at my CV and my previous projects through the tabs at the top of this page!</b></p>
