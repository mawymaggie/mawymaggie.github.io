	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<h2>My name is Wing Yi Ma, Maggie.</h2>
	<p>This is where you can get to know about me. I am currently a third year statistics students studying at <em>the University of Toronto</em>. </p>
	<p>I started studying Statistics because I am a person who loves to ask the question "Why?". 
		Finding out reasons and associations between things was always my first approach to things happening around me. </p>
	<p>When I am out of school, I love spending time on watching movies, making crafts, and listening to music.
		I would like to share my recent favourite movie - "Soul". It was very inspiriting as it introduced a new perspective about life to me. 
		As I love seeking reasons and purposes, the quote from the movie - "A spark isn't a soul's purpose" has stimulated me to reconsider the "purpose" of my life.
		Maybe life doesn't necessarily need "A purpose"? Or maybe every moment and thing I spend time on can be the "purposes"? 
		I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is trying to find a purpose in life, or just wants to be motivated in what they are doing.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in knowing more about me and my past experience as a student, feel free to have a look at my CV and my previous projects through the tabs at the top of this website!</p>
